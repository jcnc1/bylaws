Subject to any provision of law applicable to the amendment of bylaws under the California Nonprofit Corporations Code, these Bylaws or any portion of them may be altered, amended, or repealed and/ or new Bylaws adopted as follows:
1. Subject to the power of members, if any, to change or repeal these Bylaws under applicable law, by approval of the BOD unless the Bylaws amendment would materially and adversely affect the rights of members, if any, as to voting or transfer; provided, however, if the JCNC has admitted any members, then a
Bylaw specifying or changing the fixed number of Directors of the JCNC, the maximum or minimum number of Directors, or changing from a fixed to variable
BOD or vice versa, may not be adopted, amended or repealed except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this Section A; and

## SECTION B. PROCEDURE
The BOD shall initiate any amendment of these Bylaws. The BOD shall establish a three to five member Bylaws Subcommittee, which shall review, prepare and make recommendations as to the amendments.

The Bylaws Subcommittee shall present its recommendations to the BOD and the EC, who shall have an opportunity to review the changes, ask questions and approve the amendments. The Bylaws Subcommittee shall present the amendments to the membership fifteen days in advance of any town hall meeting. The Bylaws Subcommittee is required to have a town hall meeting and then at a General Body membership meeting, properly noticed, at which time, the General Body membership shall vote on the amendments. Upon approval as provided upon in this Article 15(A), the amendments to these Bylaws shall take effect.
