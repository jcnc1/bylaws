# ARTICLE 15
# AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

## SECTION A. AMENDMENT
Subject to any provision of law applicable to the amendment of bylaws under the California
Nonprofit Corporations Code, these Bylaws or any portion of them may be altered, amended, or
repealed and/ or new Bylaws adopted as follows:
1. Subject to the power of members, if any, to change or repeal these Bylaws
under applicable law, by approval of the BOD unless the Bylaws amendment
would materially and adversely affect the rights of members, if any, as to voting
or transfer; provided, however, if the JCNC has admitted any members, then a
Bylaw specifying or changing the fixed number of Directors of the JCNC, the
maximum or minimum number of Directors, or changing from a fixed to variable
BOD or vice versa, may not be adopted, amended or repealed except as provided
in subparagraph (2) of this Section A; and
2. By approval of 3/4ths of the BOD and upon 2/3rds of the returning votes of the
membership at a duly noticed meeting where at least fifteen percent (15%) of the
General membership returns votes.

## SECTION B. PROCEDURE
The BOD shall initiate any amendment of these Bylaws. The BOD shall establish a three to five
member Bylaws Subcommittee, which shall review, prepare and make recommendations as to
the amendments. The Bylaws Subcommittee shall be temporary in nature and shall terminate
upon completion of the amendment process and shall include the General Counsel of the JCNC.
The Bylaws Subcommittee shall present its recommendations to the BOD and the EC, who shall
have an opportunity to review the changes, ask questions and approve the amendments. The
Bylaws Subcommittee shall present the amendments to the membership fifteen days in advance
of any town hall meeting. The Bylaws Subcommittee is required to have a town hall meeting
and then at a General Body membership meeting, properly noticed, at which time, the General
Body membership shall vote on the amendments. Upon approval as provided upon in this
Article 15(A), the amendments to these Bylaws shall take effect.

Amendment of the Articles of Incorporation may be adopted by the approval of the BOD and by
the approval of the members of the JCNC in accordance with the California Code for Nonprofit
Religious Corporations.
