# ARTICLE 19
# CONFLICT RESOLUTION

All disputes not addressed herein fall within the purview of this Article 19.
Inter-department conflicts and disagreements, with the exception of those related to the five
religious traditions, shall be first brought before the President for resolution. If the parties are
unable to resolve the situation, then the matter shall be brought to the EC for resolution. A
majority vote of the EC shall preside over resolution of the matter. If the parties are still unable
to resolve the matter, the parties or the President may bring the matter to the Chairperson of the
BOD for resolution. Any conflict between the President and other EC members shall be brought
to the BOD for resolution.

All matters related to the five religious traditions shall be brought to and resolved by unanimous
decision of the Traditions Council, a standing committee of the BOD, as provided under Article
8(A), consisting of a member from each of the five traditions, Shwetambar, Digambar,
Sthanakwasi, Tera Panth and Shrimad Rajchandra, appointed by the BOD for a term of two (2)
years.

If the matter is not resolved, the matter shall be brought to the BOD for resolution requiring a
3/4ths majority vote of the BOD.

Any conflicts between the BOD and the EC (including any disputes between the BOD
Chairperson and the President) are to be raised before the Dispute Resolution Committee. This
committee is jointly appointed by the BOD and the EC and shall be comprised of any past BOD
Chairperson, any Ex-President, three community members and the General Counsel. The
Dispute Resolution Committee must be appointed within fifteen days of any conflict which is
brought to the joint attention of the BOD and the EC and must provide recommendations to the
BOD and the EC within forty-five days. If the Dispute Resolution Committee is unable to reach
a resolution, the Chairperson of the BOD shall call a duly noticed membership meeting to
address the situation in accordance with Article 4(J) that shall act in accordance with 2/3rds of the
returning votes of the membership.
