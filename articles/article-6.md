action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the

BOD may be filled by a 2/3rds approval of the BOD or, if the number of Directors then in office
is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous written consent of the Directors then in office, (2)

notice or waiver of notice complying with this Article 6 of these Bylaws, or (3) a sole remaining
Director.

or to the Secretary if the Chairperson is not available. Any such resignation shall take effect
upon the date of receipt of such notice or at any later date specified therein, and, unless otherwise
specified therein, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any
Director may be removed upon notice and a majority vote of the BOD from his or her position
for not attending two consecutive BOD meetings without prior notice to the Chairperson.

cause, who ceases to be of sound mind and body, who violates and acts in derogation of the

corporate funds, or who acts in self-dealing may be removed from the BOD upon 3/4ths vote of
the BOD present at a special meeting. The Director shall have an opportunity to be heard and
present any evidence, including bringing a maximum of three members in good standing in
support. In view of the sensitivity of such a matter, this special meeting shall be closed and the
Director in question shall not have an opportunity to vote and cannot assign his or her vote to any
other Director.

Should there be any vacancy on the BOD for any reason, the BOD may appoint individuals to fill
those spots consistent with the time lines of the vacating BOD member and the provisions of this
Article 6(W).
