# GENERAL MEMBERSHIP

## SECTION A. TYPES OF MEMBERSHIP QUALIFICATION AND RIGHTS OF MEMBERS
### 1. VOTING MEMBERSHIP
The JCNC shall have two types of voting memberships: (1) Individual and (2) Family.
Qualifications for all voting members in either membership are that an individual must be
eighteen (18) years of age or older, complete a JCNC membership application (only one
for a Family Membership) and pay either annual or lifetime membership dues as
provided in Article 4(C). No member shall hold more than one voting membership.
Except as expressly provided in, or authorized by, the JCNC Articles of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, each class of members shall have the same rights, privileges, restrictions
and conditions. Members shall be subject to these Bylaws and all underlying guidelines.

### 2. NON-VOTING MEMBERSHIP
The JCNC shall have a non-voting membership, either paid or unpaid, which shall be
referred to as an “affiliate membership.” Affiliate membership shall be open to
community institutions, other Jain organizations and friends of the JCNC. All affiliate
members must submit a JCNC membership application to the Executive Committee
(“EC”), which shall assess each application in the best interests of the JCNC and approve
membership upon a majority vote of the EC. Affiliate members shall not have
membership rights or voting power as provided under these Bylaws.

## SECTION B. UNIT OF MEMBERSHIP
Unless amended by a majority of the Board of Directors (“BOD”), for the purposes of dues and
assessments and entitlement to member benefits, the unit of membership shall be either annual
individual or family or lifetime individual or family. An Individual Membership, either annual
or lifetime, shall include the individual only. A Family Membership, either annual or lifetime,
shall include the following:
1. A husband and wife with unmarried children under the age of twenty-one
(21) and/or parent(s) and/or grandparent(s);
2. An individual with unmarried children under the age of twenty-one (21)
and/or parent(s) and/or grandparent(s); or
3. An individual or husband and wife with parents living with them.

Unless provided otherwise in these Bylaws, children of member families who are twenty-one
(21) years of age or older shall be required to file for membership separately and must be a
qualified JCNC member, on his or her own accord, under Article 4(A) to run for office (EC or
BOD), to vote and/or to have any membership rights as provided in these Bylaws.

## SECTION C. FEES, DUES AND ASSESSMENTS
Each member shall be assessed membership dues based upon the type of membership elected,
either annual or lifetime individual or annual or lifetime family. Upon recommendation of the
EC, the BOD may amend the membership dues upon a majority vote of the BOD.

Annual membership dues (for a 12-month period commencing on January 1st of the year and
ending on December 31st of the same year) shall be due and paid on or before June 1st of the
calendar year. There is no apportionment of dues. Nonpayment of dues may result in
suspension or termination of the membership. To be eligible to vote and run for the EC or BOD
positions, a member must be in valid paid status with membership dues paid before June 1st of
the same year. Payments made after June 1st will provide membership benefits only with the
exception of voting rights for the current calendar year.

Request for a financial hardship waiver of the annual dues for either Individual or Family
Membership must be made in writing and submitted to the EC. The EC shall review each
request on a case-by-case basis and shall grant the waiver upon a majority vote of the EC in
favor of the waiver.

All donations and dues to the JCNC are not subject to any refunds.

## SECTION D. MEMBERSHIP RECORDS
The JCNC shall maintain membership records, electronic or otherwise, as provided in Article 12.

All notices or newsletters provided to members shall be sent to mailing or email addresses on
record. Each member must provide the JCNC with any change of address, phone number, email
address or other contact information to timely receive all communications and notices for
election. The JCNC’s membership records shall constitute the JCNC membership list and shall
be used, in whole or in part, by a JCNC member, officer, director, employee, volunteer or agent
only for JCNC business or for any purpose reasonably related to any member’s membership
interest. Membership information concerning any JCNC member shall not be disclosed to
anyone for non-JCNC business (excluding JAINA-related activities).

## SECTION E. NONTRANSFERABILITY OF MEMBERSHIPS
No member may transfer their membership or transfer any right(s) arising from membership to
any third party outside their membership class.

All membership rights shall cease upon the member’s death, with the exception of a Family
Membership. Upon the death of one of the spouses in a Family Membership, the membership
rights shall pass to the surviving spouse, with the exception of voting rights. No voting rights of
the deceased spouse shall pass to the surviving spouse. The surviving spouse shall continue to
have his or her one (1) vote.

In case of dissolution of marriage involving a lifetime Family Membership, within two years of
the final judgment of dissolution, the lifetime family members can (1) jointly assign in writing
the full lifetime membership to one of the family members and convert the lifetime Family
Membership to a lifetime Individual Membership; or (2) receive a credit equivalent to 50% of
the lifetime Family Membership dues paid and apply it to a new lifetime Individual Membership
for each member. In no event shall a cash refund be provided.

## SECTION F. MEMBERSHIP VOTING RIGHTS
Each voting member in good standing shall be entitled to vote at all General Body membership
