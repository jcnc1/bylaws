present and provided that either before or after the meeting each Officer not present has signed a
waiver of notice, a consent to holding the meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof. All
such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of
the minutes of the meeting.

## SECTION P. QUORUM FOR MEETINGS
A quorum shall consist of a majority of the elected Officers.

Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or in the Articles of Incorporation, or under the
California Corporations Code, no business shall be considered by the EC at any meeting at which

is a motion to adjourn. When a meeting is adjourned for lack of a quorum, it shall not be
necessary to give any notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to
be transacted at such meeting, other than by announcement at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken, except as provided in Section 7S.

The Officers present at a duly called and held meeting at which a quorum is initially present may
continue to do business notwithstanding the loss of a quorum at the meeting due to a withdrawal
of Officers from the meeting, provided that any action thereafter taken must be approved by at
least a majority of the required quorum for such meeting or such greater percentage as may be
required by California law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

Meetings must only occur at which a quorum is present. And every act, or decision done, or

provisions relating to the appointment of committees (Section 9212), approval of contracts or

keeping in mind the principles of Roberts’ Rules of Order or formal parliamentary rules as such

conflict with these Bylaws, with the Articles of Incorporation, or with provisions of California
law.

## SECTION S. ACTION BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT MEETING

without a meeting if all Officers, individually or collectively, consent in writing to such action.
Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the EC.
Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as the unanimous vote of the
Officers. Any certificate or other document filed under any provision of law which relates to
action so taken shall state that the action was taken by unanimous written consent of the EC
without a meeting and that the Bylaws of the JCNC authorize the Officers to so act, and such
statement shall be prima facie evidence of such authority.

## SECTION T. VACANCY
Vacancies on the EC shall exist upon the death, resignation or removal of any Officer or when
the number of authorized EC positions is increased. Any unfilled position subject to an election
is deemed a vacancy.

The EC may also declare an Officer’s position vacant if he or she has been declared of unsound
mind by final order of a court, or convicted of a felony, or has been removed from office by
order of the Superior Court for engaging in fraudulent acts pursuant to Section 9223 of the
California Nonprofit Religious Corporations Code.

Any vacancy caused by the death, resignation, removal, disqualification, or otherwise, of any
Officer shall be filled within one month by appointment following a 2/3 vote of the EC members
present at a meeting to later be ratified by a majority of the BOD members. In the event of a
vacancy in any office other than that of President, the President may temporarily fill the vacancy
until such time as the vacancy can be filled by membership election.

A person elected to fill a vacancy as provided by this section shall hold office until the end of the
prior Officer’s term, until the next annual election of the EC or until his or her death (whichever
comes first), resignation or removal from office.

individual may serve on the EC after having served following being elected as President without
any gap before election to other EC positions or the BOD.

Additionally, EC members (including the President) are subject to the restrictions prohibiting
bias further described in Article 9(D).

## SECTION V. REMOVAL AND RESIGNATION
Any EC Officer may resign at any time upon giving written notice to the President, or to the
Chairperson of the BOD if the President is not available. Any such resignation shall take effect
at the date of receipt of such notice or at any later date specified therein and, unless otherwise
specified, acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

Upon such a vacancy, the EC must communicate to the entire membership the vacancy (e.g.,
email) and solicit proposed nominees for a period of fifteen days prior to proposing any
appointments to fill such vacancy.

Any Officer, including the President, may be removed from office as provided herein.

Any Officer who materially fails to perform the duties of his or her position without reasonable
cause, who ceases to be of sound mind and body, or who violates and acts in derogation of the
JCNC’s mission, principles and ethics, or who flagrantly violates the oath of office, or who
embezzles corporate funds, or who acts in self-dealing, may be removed from the EC upon a
3/4ths vote of the entire EC and a majority vote of the entire BOD (excluding the person being
removed) after a termination process as defined in the guidelines, including a reasonable
opportunity for the Officer to be heard and/or present any evidence or witnesses to the contrary
following a closed-door meeting where the Officer in question will not vote. Should a President
resign, the majority of the BOD is empowered to appoint a replacement for the remainder of that
term.
