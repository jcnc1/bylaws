# ARTICLE 11
# INDEMNIFICATION/INSURANCE

## SECTION A. INDEMNIFICATION
1. Definition. For the purpose of this Article 11, the following definitions shall
apply:
a. “Agent” means any person who is or was a member, benefactor, director,
Officer, employee, or other agent of JCNC, or is or was serving at the
request of the JCNC as a benefactor, Director, Officer, employee or agent;
b. “Proceeding” means any threatened, pending or complete action or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative; and
c. “Expenses” includes, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses of
establishing the right to indemnification under this Article 11.
2. Personal Liabilities. All of the members of the JCNC shall be immune from
civil liability in accordance with the California Corporations Code, Section 9246.
3. Indemnification. As provided under the California Corporations Code,
Section 9246:
   1. The JCNC shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an
action by or in the right of JCNC to procure a judgment in its favor, an
action brought under Section 9243, or an action brought by the Attorney
General pursuant to Section 9230) by reason of the fact that such person is
or was an agent, as provided in this Article 11(A)(1)(a) of JCNC, against
expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and
reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person
acted in good faith and in a manner such person believed to be in the best
interests of JCNC and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful. The
termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction
or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a
manner which the person believed to be in the best interests of JCNC or
that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct
was unlawful.
   1. The JCNC shall have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action by or in the right of JCNC, or brought under Section
9243, or brought by the Attorney General pursuant to Section 9230, to
procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or
was an agent of the corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action if the person acted in good faith, in a manner in which such
person believed to be in the best interests of JCNC and with such care,
including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinary prudent person in a like
position would use under similar circumstances. No indemnification shall
be made under this subsection (b):

4. In respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have
been adjudged to be liable to JCNC in the performance of such person’s duty to
the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such
proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all
the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for the expenses which such court shall determine;
5. Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a threatened or pending
action, with or without court approval; or
6. Of expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action which is
settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval unless it is settled with
the approval of the Attorney General.
   1. To the extent that an agent of the JCNC has been successful on the merits
in defense of any proceeding referred to herein or in defense of any claim,
issue or matter therein, the JCNC agent shall be indemnified against
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection
therewith.
   1. Except as provided in subsection (c), any indemnification under this
Article 11(A) shall be made by the JCNC only if authorized in the specific
case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in
the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth by: (1) a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
Directors who are not parties to such proceeding; (2) approval of the
members (Section 5034) with the persons to be indemnified not being
entitled to vote thereon; or (3) the court in which such proceeding is or
was pending upon application made by JCNC or the agent or the attorney
or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether
or not such application by the agent, attorney or other person is opposed
by the JCNC.
   1. Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the
JCNC prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such amount unless it
shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be indemnified
as authorized in this Article 11(A).
   1. No provision made by the JCNC to indemnify its Directors or Officers for
the defense of any proceeding, whether contained in the Articles of
Incorporation, these Bylaws, a resolution of the members or Directors, an
agreement or otherwise, shall be valid unless inconsistent with this Article
11(A). Nothing contained in this Article 11(A) shall affect any right to
indemnification to which persons other than such Directors and Officers
may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
   1. No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article 11(A),
except as provided herein in any circumstance where it appears that: (1) it
would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles of Incorporation,
these Bylaws, a resolution of the members or an agreement in effect at the
time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the
proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were
paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (2) it would
be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in
approving a settlement.

## SECTION B. INSURANCE
The BOD will adopt a resolution authorizing the purchase and maintenance of insurance on
behalf of any agent of JCNC (including a Director, Officer, employee or other agent of the
corporation) against any liability other than for violating provisions of law relating to self-
dealing (Section 9243 of the California Nonprofit Religious Corporation Law) asserted against or
incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent’s status as such, whether or not
JCNC would have the power to indemnify the agent against such liability under the provisions of
Section 9246 of the California Nonprofit Religious Corporation Law.

The EC (through the VP of Finance) shall purchase and maintain all other insurance, including,
but not limited to, general liability, premises, directors and officers’ insurance and workmen’s
compensation insurance, as required in the best interest of the JCNC.
