# BENEFACTORS

## SECTION A. QUALIFICATION
Any JCNC individual or family member over the age of eighteen (18) in good standing who
donates $5,001 or greater to the JCNC shall be known as a benefactor to the JCNC for the term
provided in Section C of this Article 5. This amount may only be increased by a majority vote
of the BOD and the EC. There is no limitation as to the number of benefactors.

## SECTION B. DUTIES/RESPONSIBILITIES
Benefactors have no duties or responsibilities to govern or operate the JCNC, except for those
benefactors who are elected to the EC, those qualified benefactors who are elected to the BOD,
to any special committees or subcommittees, or who act as JCNC volunteers. Benefactors may
act as advisors to the JCNC as required without any compensation.

As provided in Article 6(D), there shall be six benefactors elected to the BOD, with two
benefactors elected to the BOD every year for a term of three years. In the three years following
the adoption of the Third Amended Bylaws, the number of benefactors elected to the BOD shall
be decreased by one position each year from nine to six.

All qualified benefactors elected to the Board of Directors shall be in good standing as
benefactors and as members throughout their terms as outlined in this Article 5 and in Article 4.

## SECTION C. TERM
The benefactor term shall vary according to the amount of monies donated and paid in
accordance with Table 1: Term Chart and Section D below. Table 1 provides the minimum
amount of donation required. Table 1 may be amended from time to time but only upon a
majority vote of the BOD and the EC.

**TABLE 1: TERM CHART**
| AMOUNT OF DONATION | TERM     |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| $50,001 & greater  | Life.    |
| $25,001 - $50,000  | 6 years  |
| $ 5,001 - $25,000  | 3 years  |

## SECTION D. CONDITIONS AND PAYMENTS
A member in good standing wishing to donate $5,001 to $25,000 to qualify for a benefactor term
of three (3) years, $25,001 to $50,000 for a benefactor term of six (6) years, or $50,001 or more
for a benefactor life term, shall make a commitment orally or in writing as to the donation
amount and make the payment before the end of the next calendar year, but a minimum payment
of $5,001 before June 1st of the current calendar year in order to be part of the pool of
benefactors on the record date for election purposes.

Any payments made by member(s) for Benefactor status from June 2 to the end of the same
calendar year will enable the Benefactor member to run for and be eligible to run for a
Benefactor BOD seat in the following calendar year. All benefactor benefits, if any, shall
commence upon payment.

Failure to make the required payments will result in disqualification as a benefactor and of
availability to run for office, i.e., for a benefactor BOD position, as provided below in Articles
5(E) and 5(G).

## SECTION E. BENEFACTOR BOD POSITION PREREQUISITES

A member wishing to nominate himself or herself for a benefactor BOD position must pre-
qualify by (1) being a JCNC member in good standing for the past twelve months; (2) having
paid the minimum donation amount for a three year term by June 1 of the current calendar year
as provided above in Article 5(D); (3) having a remaining valid benefactor term of three years;
and (4) meeting the BOD qualifications as outlined in Article 6(B). Failure to comply with these
prerequisites will disqualify a benefactor BOD nominee.

## SECTION F. ELECTION OF BENEFACTORS TO THE BOD
The benefactor BOD positions shall be elected by a majority of the members voting at a duly
held election. All members in good standing can vote for available benefactor BOD positions.

## SECTION G. VACANCIES, REMOVAL AND SURVIVORSHIP
Benefactors may vacate, or be removed from, a benefactor position. A vacancy will be said to
exist on the death, resignation or removal of any benefactor, or if a benefactor has been declared
of unsound mind by final order of a court, or convicted of a felony, or has been removed from
office by order of the Superior Court for engaging in fraudulent acts pursuant to § 9223 of the
California Nonprofit Corporations Code.

A benefactor may be removed by a majority vote of the BOD for failure to maintain good
standing or comply with the conditions of the payment plan as provided in Article 5(C)-(E) and
for failure to cure upon thirty days’ notice by the EC or the BOD.

Upon the death of a benefactor in valid status, the benefactor’s rights and responsibilities shall
pass to the benefactor’s surviving spouse, with the exception of any position that the benefactor
held, such as a benefactor BOD position, which is non-transferable.

## SECTION H. ANNUAL MEETING OF BENEFACTORS
A meeting of all of the benefactors in valid status shall be held annually around September and
be presided over by the BOD Chairperson. The meeting shall be advisory in nature to get advice
and input from the benefactors.
