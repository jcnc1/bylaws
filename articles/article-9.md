## SECTION D. REQUIREMENTS/RESTRICTIONS TO RUNNING FOR OFFICE
All nominees shall be required to sign a declaration acknowledging adherence to the JCNC Code
of Conduct in order to run for any BOD or EC position. Any nominee who has not or will not
sign or has not signed the declaration may be disqualified from running.

All BOD and EC members must subscribe to the JCNC Code of Conduct (which may be
modified from time to time by the BOD) as a prerequisite for nomination to the BOD or the EC.

Any issue regarding a nominee’s qualification to run for the position selected shall be resolved in
accordance with the procedures outlined in Article 9(C) by the Election Committee and General
Counsel, as required. If for any reason the General Counsel and Election Committee are not able
to resolve the issue, they will bring the matter before a committee consisting of the BOD
Chairperson, an Ex-President member of the BOD and a community member of the BOD
selected by a majority of the BOD. If the nominee disagrees with the decision of this group, the
nominee may appeal the decision to the whole BOD.

In order to run for a BOD position or President, the nominee must have previously served on the
BOD or the EC for a minimum of two years.

Eligibility to run for a BOD or EC position in the case of a Family Membership shall extend only
to the husband or wife or to the primary individual (where the family member is unmarried) and
not to the children or elderly parents living within the family.

To avoid the appearance of bias, for any BOD or EC position term, only one spouse or the
primary individual may run for and/or hold a BOD or an EC position. Both spouses cannot run
for and/or hold a BOD and/or an EC position concurrently. If one family member is already on
the EC and/or BOD, then any application by a second family member is automatically
disqualified. Further, one member may not hold multiple positions within the BOD and/or EC.
A member may only hold one BOD or EC position at any given time. If a Director or Officer is
elected for or accepts another Director or Officer position, the original position of the member
will be automatically vacated.

## SECTION E. VOTING
Each eligible voter can vote for available EC and BOD positions. Each qualified individual
member shall receive one (1) ballot and each qualified family member shall receive two (2)
ballots. Each ballot shall constitute one vote of the member.

Directors and Officers may be elected by written ballot. Such ballots for the election of
Directors and Officers shall list the persons nominated at the time the ballots are mailed or
delivered. If any such ballots are marked “withhold” or otherwise marked in a manner indicating
that the authority to vote for the election of Directors or Officers is withheld, they shall not be
counted as votes either for or against the election of a Director or Officer.

Those nominees receiving the greatest number of votes for his/her respective position shall be
elected to that position.

In the event of a tie, a second election shall be held and should the second election also result in
a tie then (1) the elected President shall cast a vote and settle any tie vote amongst two
candidates for an available EC position; and (2) the Chairperson of the BOD shall cast a vote and
settle any tie for the position of President or any BOD position.

## SECTION F. RECOUNT
Any nominee may request one (1) recount of the ballots within three days of the announcement
of the election results. Any totals of results within two percent of each other shall be allowed
and considered final.

## SECTION G. REMOVAL
An Election Committee member may be removed from office upon a finding of wrongdoing, of
coercion, of fixing the Election Process, or of any other act in derogation of the JCNC principles,
ethics and mission. Removal shall be determined upon majority approval of the BOD.

A candidate for nomination or a nominee may be disqualified or removed from the Election
Process by the Election Committee upon prior consultation with the General Counsel if the
candidate or nominee or anyone working for him or her in the election violates the Election
Process, does not comply with the election guidelines, rules and regulations as provided by the
Election Committee, acts in derogation of the JCNC principles, ethics and mission, uses coercive
election tactics or attempts to purchase election votes from other members.
